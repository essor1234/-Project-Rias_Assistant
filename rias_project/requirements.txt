# Core LLM chaining and API integration (supports Grok/xAI via custom chains, OpenAI, Anthropic)
langchain==0.3.1  # For prompt chaining, routing between models, and workflow automation

# PDF text extraction and browsing (essential for ingesting research papers)
pymupdf==1.24.10  # Fast PDF parsing; handles text, images, and math descriptions

# Excel file manipulation for the comparison template
openpyxl==3.1.5  # Reads/writes .xlsx files, populates sheets with extracted data

# Word document generation for per-paper summaries
python-docx==1.1.2  # Creates structured .docx files with sections like Problem Solving, Key Ideas

# API clients for LLMs (Grok via langchain; add these for Claude and GPT)
anthropic==0.38.0  # Official SDK for Claude API integration
openai==1.51.0  # Official SDK for GPT models; use with langchain for chaining

# Data handling and efficiency computations (e.g., metrics in .xlsx)
pandas==2.2.3  # For data frames to compute efficiencies like mAP per Param

# Optional but useful for zipping outputs (built-in zipfile is fine, but this adds convenience if needed)
# No extra package needed; use Python's standard library for folders/zipping
