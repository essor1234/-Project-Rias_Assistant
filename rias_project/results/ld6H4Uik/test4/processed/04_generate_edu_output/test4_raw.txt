      "Equation": "mAP = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} AP_i",
      "ImageIdea": "A bar chart showing different AP values for various object classes.",
      "ConceptExplanation": "Mean Average Precision (mAP) is a way to measure how well a model detects objects.",
      "DeepExplanation": "Imagine you have a test with multiple questions, and you want to know your average score. mAP is like that average score, but for detecting objects in images.",
      "GraphIdea": "A line graph showing mAP improvement over different models.",
      "Example": "In the paper, mAP improved by 1.27 to 2.79 points when using MapFusion.",
      "Content": "Mean Average Precision (mAP) helps us understand how good a model is at finding objects. It's like getting an average score on a test. In this study, using MapFusion improved the mAP, meaning the model got better at detecting objects."

      "Title": "Understanding False Positives and False Negatives",
      "Equation": "Precision = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP}, \\quad Recall = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN}",
      "ImageIdea": "Two diagrams: one showing a few false positives and another showing a few false negatives.",
      "ConceptExplanation": "False positives are mistakes where the model thinks it sees something, but it's wrong. False negatives are when the model misses something.",
      "DeepExplanation": "Imagine you're looking for your friend in a crowd. If you wave at someone who isn't your friend, that's a false positive. If you miss seeing your friend, that's a false negative.",
      "GraphIdea": "A confusion matrix showing true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true negatives.",
      "Example": "The paper shows that MapFusion helps reduce false positives in 3D object detection.",
      "Content": "False positives and false negatives are common mistakes in object detection. A false positive is like waving at the wrong person, and a false negative is missing your friend in a crowd. MapFusion helps reduce these mistakes, making the model more accurate."

      "ConceptExplanation": "HDMaps provide detailed information about roads and surroundings, which helps in detecting objects more accurately.",
      "DeepExplanation": "Think of HDMaps like a detailed map of a theme park. It shows where everything is, helping you find rides and attractions easily. In object detection, HDMaps help the model understand the environment better.",
      "GraphIdea": "A comparison chart showing detection accuracy with and without HDMaps.",
      "Example": "In the study, using HDMaps with MapFusion improved detection accuracy by providing more context.",
      "Content": "HDMaps are like detailed maps that help models understand their surroundings better. By combining these maps with other data, models can detect objects more accurately. In this research, using HDMaps improved the model's ability to find objects."
