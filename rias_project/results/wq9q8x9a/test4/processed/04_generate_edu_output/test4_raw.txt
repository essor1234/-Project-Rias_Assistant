      "ConceptExplanation": "Mean Average Precision (mAP) is a way to measure how well a model detects objects.",
      "DeepExplanation": "Imagine you have a list of objects to find, like cars and bikes. mAP tells you how good you are at finding all of them, on average.",

      "Example": "In the paper, mAP improved by 1.27 to 2.79 points using MapFusion.",
      "Content": "Mean Average Precision (mAP) is a key metric for evaluating object detection models. It averages the precision of detecting different objects, like cars and bikes. In this study, using MapFusion improved mAP by 1.27 to 2.79 points, showing better detection performance."

      "ImageIdea": "Two diagrams: one showing a correct detection (TP) and another showing a false detection (FP).",
      "ConceptExplanation": "False positives are when the model thinks it sees something, but it's wrong. False negatives are when it misses something.",
      "DeepExplanation": "Think of false positives like thinking you see a friend in a crowd, but it's a stranger. False negatives are like missing your friend in the crowd.",
      "GraphIdea": "A confusion matrix showing TP, FP, FN, and TN.",
      "Example": "MapFusion helps reduce false positives in 3D object detection.",
      "Content": "In object detection, false positives occur when the model incorrectly identifies an object, while false negatives happen when it misses an object. MapFusion reduces false positives, improving detection accuracy."
