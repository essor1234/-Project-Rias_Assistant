      "ConceptExplanation": "Mean Average Precision (mAP) is a way to measure how well a model detects objects.",
      "DeepExplanation": "Imagine you have a basket of fruits, and you want to see how well you can pick out apples, oranges, and bananas. mAP is like checking how good you are at picking each fruit and then finding the average.",
      "GraphIdea": "A line graph showing mAP improvement over different models.",
      "Example": "In the paper, mAP is used to evaluate how well the MapFusion framework improves 3D object detection.",
      "Content": "Mean Average Precision (mAP) helps us understand how well a model detects different objects. It's like checking how good you are at picking different fruits and then finding the average. In the paper, mAP shows how MapFusion improves 3D object detection."

      "ImageIdea": "Two diagrams: one showing a correct detection (TP) and another showing a false detection (FP).",
      "ConceptExplanation": "False positives are when the model thinks something is there, but it's not. False negatives are when the model misses something that is there.",
      "DeepExplanation": "Imagine you are looking for your friend in a crowd. If you wave at someone who isn't your friend, that's a false positive. If you miss seeing your friend, that's a false negative.",
      "GraphIdea": "A confusion matrix showing TP, FP, FN, and TN.",
      "Example": "In the paper, reducing false positives and negatives is crucial for better 3D object detection.",
      "Content": "False positives happen when the model thinks something is there, but it's not. False negatives are when the model misses something that is there. In the paper, reducing these errors is key to improving 3D object detection."
