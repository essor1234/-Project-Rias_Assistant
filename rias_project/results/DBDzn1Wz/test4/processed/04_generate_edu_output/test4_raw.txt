      "Example": "In the paper, mAP improved by 1.27 to 2.79 points using MapFusion.",
      "Content": "Mean Average Precision (mAP) is a metric that helps us understand how well our model is detecting objects. It's like getting an average score for finding different items, such as cars and bikes. In the paper, using MapFusion improved the mAP by 1.27 to 2.79 points, showing better detection performance."
