      "Content": "Object detection is like a game of 'I Spy' for computers. It helps them find and name different things in a picture, like cars or people. This is super important for things like self-driving cars, which need to know what's around them to drive safely."

      "Example": "Faster R-CNN is used in security cameras to detect intruders.",
      "Content": "Two-stage detection methods like Faster R-CNN work by first finding areas in an image that might contain objects. Then, they take a closer look at these areas to figure out exactly what the objects are. This method is very accurate, like a careful treasure hunt!"
