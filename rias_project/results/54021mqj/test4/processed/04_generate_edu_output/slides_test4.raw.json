      "ConceptExplanation": "mAP is a way to measure how well a model detects objects. It averages the precision across different classes.",
      "DeepExplanation": "Imagine you have a basket of fruits and you want to see how well you can pick out apples, oranges, and bananas. mAP helps you see how good you are at picking each fruit and then gives you an overall score.",

      "Example": "In the paper, mAP is used to evaluate how well the MapFusion framework detects cars, pedestrians, and other objects.",
      "Content": "Mean Average Precision (mAP) is a key metric for evaluating object detection models. It calculates the average precision for each class and then averages these scores. In the context of the paper, mAP helps assess how well the MapFusion framework detects various objects like cars and pedestrians."
