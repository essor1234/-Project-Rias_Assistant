      "Equation": "mAP = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} AP_i",
      "ImageIdea": "A bar chart showing different AP values for various object classes.",
      "ConceptExplanation": "Mean Average Precision (mAP) is a way to measure how well a model detects objects.",
      "DeepExplanation": "Imagine you have a test with many questions, and you want to know your average score. mAP is like finding the average score for detecting different objects, like cars and pedestrians.",
      "GraphIdea": "A line graph showing mAP improvement over different models.",
      "Example": "In the paper, mAP improved by 1.27 to 2.79 points when using MapFusion.",
      "Content": "Mean Average Precision (mAP) helps us understand how good a model is at finding objects. It's like averaging your scores across different subjects in school. In this study, using MapFusion improved mAP, showing better object detection."

      "Title": "Understanding False Positives and False Negatives",
      "Equation": "Precision = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP}, \\quad Recall = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN}",
      "ImageIdea": "Two circles showing overlap between true and predicted objects, highlighting false positives and negatives.",
      "ConceptExplanation": "False positives are when the model thinks something is there, but it's not. False negatives are when the model misses something that is there.",
      "DeepExplanation": "Think of false positives like thinking you have more candies than you actually do, and false negatives like missing candies that are actually in your bag.",
      "GraphIdea": "A confusion matrix showing true positives, false positives, and false negatives.",
      "Example": "The paper shows that MapFusion reduces false positives in 3D object detection.",
      "Content": "False positives and negatives are mistakes a model can make. Reducing these errors means the model is better at detecting objects. MapFusion helps reduce false positives, making the detection more accurate."

      "Example": "MapFusion uses HDMaps to improve detection accuracy by providing more context.",
      "Content": "HDMaps are like super-detailed maps that help models understand the environment better. By using HDMaps, MapFusion improves the accuracy of detecting objects, making it easier for the model to know where things are."
