      "Example": "The paper uses HDMaps to improve the detection of objects like cars and pedestrians by providing additional context.",
      "Content": "HDMaps are like super detailed maps that provide extra information about the environment, such as road layouts and traffic signs. By fusing these map features with voxel features, the MapFusion framework improves the accuracy of 3D object detection. This helps in better identifying objects like cars and pedestrians in autonomous driving scenarios."
