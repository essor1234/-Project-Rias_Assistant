      "ImageIdea": "A scene with various objects like cars, people, and signs, each with a box around them.",
      "ConceptExplanation": "Object detection is about finding and identifying objects in pictures.",
      "DeepExplanation": "Imagine you have a picture of a busy street. Object detection helps a computer find and name things like cars, people, and traffic lights in that picture.",

      "Example": "Detecting cars and pedestrians in a street scene for self-driving cars.",
      "Content": "Object detection is like a game of 'I Spy' for computers. It helps them find and name objects in pictures, which is super important for things like self-driving cars to know what's around them."
