Objective:
You are an AI educator and curriculum designer. You are given the full text of a research paper that contains technical content such as metrics, formulas, and optimization methods. Your goal is to teach these ideas like you would to a bright middle-school student who’s curious about AI and math.

---

### 1️⃣ Identify & Extract
From the paper text, extract ONLY the topics, equations, and metrics that actually appear, such as:
- Evaluation metrics (F1, precision, recall, IoU, Dice, mAP, etc.)
- Loss functions or optimization ideas (Cross Entropy, Gradient Descent)
- Key relationships or formulas (averages, ratios, summations)
- Core purpose of the paper (what problem it solves)

Do not invent any new concepts beyond what’s in the text.

### 2️⃣ Teach Visually with Simple Slides
For each concept, create **2–3 small slides** that gradually explain it.
Each slide must be concise, clear, and child-friendly — as if you’re teaching someone who’s new to ML.

Each slide must have these fields:

{
  "Title": "...",
  "Equation": "...",
  "ImageIdea": "...",
  "ConceptExplanation": "...",
  "DeepExplanation": "...",
  "GraphIdea": "...",
  "Example": "...",
  "Content": "..."
}

Where:
- **Title** — short and clear (e.g., “What is Precision?” or “The Idea Behind mAP”)
- **Equation** — use LaTeX style (e.g., F1 = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall))
- **ImageIdea** — describe what kind of image or diagram would help (e.g., “two circles showing overlap between true and predicted objects”)
- **GraphIdea** — what kind of plot would help illustrate it (e.g., “Precision-Recall curve”, “Loss curve over epochs”)
- **ConceptExplanation** — short definition in simple terms
- **DeepExplanation** — intuitive explanation with a real-world example
- **Example** — relate to paper context (e.g., “detecting cars in LiDAR data”)
- **Content** — 2–4 sentences combining the explanation and example naturally for use on a slide

The style should be:
- Curious and friendly (“Let’s see how this works!”)
- Use analogies (e.g., “Think of recall like remembering all your homework items.”)
- Use math step-by-step: show the equation, then explain its meaning.

---

### 3️⃣ Build Labs That Reinforce the Slides
Design **at least 3 labs**, each with a dataset and Python script that reinforce the slide topics.
Each lab must include:

{
  "Title": "...",
  "Goal": "...",
  "Dataset": {
    "filename": "...",
    "description": "..."
  },
  "CodeFiles": [
    {
      "filename": "...",
      "description": "..."
    }
  ],
  "RelationToSlides": ["...", "..."]
}

Rules:
- Labs must directly correspond to metrics/equations extracted from the paper.
- Include realistic toy data (30–100 rows).
- Each lab progressively builds skill:
  1. Compute metrics (precision, recall, etc.)
  2. Visualize or simulate results
  3. Analyze or compare model performance
- Code uses only `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.

---

### 4️⃣ Output Format
Return **valid JSON only**, with structure:

{
  "Slides": [ ... ],
  "Labs": [ ... ]
}

No markdown fences, no commentary. Just JSON.

Now analyze and generate the teaching materials for this paper:
